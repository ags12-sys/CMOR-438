# CMOR-438: Data Science and Machine Learning

**Purpose:** To implement Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning using the real data sets _____, ____, and ____. 

**Libraries:** This repository uses the libraries NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and SciKit Learn in order to implement the Supervised and Unsupervised Learning models.

### Supervised Learning

Included in the Supervised Learning folder is implementations of the following models:

-Perceptron
-Gradient Descent
-Linear Regression
-Logistic Regression
-Neural Networks 
-K-Nearest Neighbors
-Decision Trees
-Ensemble
-Multilayer Perceptron
-Random Forest

Each other these folders include a README.md which describes the models in detail as well as how to reproduce the results provided. 

### Unsupervised Learning

Included in the Unsupervised Learning folder is implementations of the following models:

-Principle Component Analysis
-K-Means Clustering
-DBSCAN
