# CMOR-438: Data Science and Machine Learning

**Purpose:** To implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning using the real data sets Wine Quality and California Housing.

**Libraries:** This repository uses the libraries SciKit Learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn to implement both the supervised and unsupervised learning models.

## Supervised Learning

The Supervised Learning folder contains implementations of the following models:

- Perceptron
- Gradient Descent
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble methods
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Random Forest

Each of these folders includes a README.md that describes the model details and explains how to reproduce the provided results.

## Unsupervised Learning

The Unsupervised Learning folder contains implementations of the following models:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN

Each of these folders includes a README.md that describes the model details and explains how to reproduce the provided results.
