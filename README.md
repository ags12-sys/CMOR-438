# CMOR-438: Data Science and Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository demonstrates implementations of **supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning algorithms using real datasets:

- **Wine Quality Dataset** (red wine chemical properties)
- **California Housing Dataset** (housing prices)

The goal is to explore model building, evaluation, and reproducibility, while including **inline testing** for correctness and robustness.
